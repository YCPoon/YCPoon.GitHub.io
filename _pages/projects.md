Completed Projects
======

------------------------------- 

**$80 Computer Initiative**
- A project to build cheap computers under the cost of $80 as an initiative to provide underpriviledge children access to computers
- How did we built it?
> 1. We first purchased and used [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) as the computer's main CPU.
> 2. We later bought second-hand monitors, microphones, keyboards, mouse, and speakers to integrate it with the Raspberry Pi computer.
> 3. To make the computer compatible with daily-use applications, we installed [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-projects/), which is a free open-source OS available on the internet, to the computer.
> 4. Packaging all of it together, we have a fully functional $80 computer that is capable of running basic applications such as Word, Excel, and even access the internet.
- Amount of Computers Built and Donated: 4
- We hope that through this initiative, we can contribute towards combating the computer iliteracy issue among underpriveledged children in our country, Malaysia
