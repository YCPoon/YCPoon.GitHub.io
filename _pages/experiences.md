Work Experiences
======

-------------------------------  

**University of Michigan Solar Car Team**, Aug 2023 to Present  
*Microsystems and Firmware Engineer* 
![SC](/images/sclogo.png){: .align-right width="350px"} 
- Designed the schematics and layout for a PCB that controls the car’s headlights, stop lights, and turn signals with Altium.
- Led in redesigning the dashboard PCB to integrate Battery Management System (BMS) controls to the dashboard. 
- Assisted in the software and hardware integration of the car’s sensors with the GPIO pins of the main MCU.
- Analyzed and rewrote the firmware code for the car’s light and brake system to increase the response time by ~120%
- Developed a RTOS-based firmware that handles interrupts and schedules tasks for the MCU based on specific priorities.
